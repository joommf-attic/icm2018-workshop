# JOOMMF workshop
ICM2018, San Francisco, USA, 15 July 2018

## Before the workshop

Although we expect to have relatively good WiFi during the workshop, we recommend to all participants to attempt to install JOOMMF on their laptops if they want to follow live demos and do the exercises during the workshop.

### Installation

We strongly recommend installing `joommf` by using `conda` package manager. Detailed installation video instructions for all three major operating systems are available on YouTube:

- Windows: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qm9QD7EfJ1Y
- MacOS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgoJ2g4j7Mo
- Linux: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yzg58boZCgI

If you decide to follow the video tutorials, you can skip the following two steps.

#### 1. Getting Anaconda

[Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) for your operating system and follow instructions on the download page. Further information about installing Anaconda can be found [here](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/download.html).

#### 2. Installing JOOMMF

`joommf` is installed using `conda` by running

    conda install --channel conda-forge joommf

in your terminal/command prompt. For further information on the `conda` package, dependency, and environment management, please have a look at its [documentation](https://conda.io/docs/). 

## Updating

Before the workshop, we recommend to the participants to upgrade `joommf` by running

    conda upgrade joommf
    
## JOOMMF in the cloud

For those participants who were not able to install JOOMMF on their laptops, we will provide the option of running JOOMMF in the cloud. However, because we are not sure about the quality of WiFi during the workshop, we cannot guarantee the quality of the service.
